# Exercise 2: Randomizing Treatment Assignment

This project demonstrates how to simulate different experimental designs:

- Simple random assignment
- Complete random assignment
- Block randomization
- Cluster randomization

**Skills Highlighted:**
- Use of the `randomizr` package
- Linear modeling to check balance
- Simulation-based thinking for research design
