# Java Coursework Showcase

This repository includes Java projects from coursework that demonstrate my skills in:

- Object-oriented programming
- GUI development using Swing
- Logic-based game implementation
- Sorting and array manipulation

While these are general computer science projects, they reflect core skills useful in research support rolesâ€”like logical thinking, structured code, and user-oriented design.

## Projects
### ðŸŽ® `mastermind/`
A full implementation of the Mastermind game using Java Swing for the user interface.

### ðŸ“Š `array-sort/`
Programs for sorting and manipulating arrays, along with test cases.
